Unilever PLC — Equity Research & Valuation 
This project is a full equity research initiation on Unilever PLC (ULVR, LSE). It blends a fundamental business review with three complementary valuation frameworks like DCF, Residual Income, and Multiples—and cross-checks the outputs with peer benchmarking, Porter’s Five Forces, ESG/governance analysis, and recent news flow to deliver an investment view. The report ultimately argues for a Buy/Strong Buy stance with meaningful upside versus the spot price at the time of writing.

Research scope & objectives
Scope: Initiation coverage of Unilever (global FMCG) across Beauty & Wellbeing, Personal Care, Home Care, Nutrition, and Ice Cream. 
Core objectives: (1) capture medium-term drivers of top-line, margins, and cash conversion; (2) translate them into FCF and economic profit; (3) triangulate intrinsic value using three valuation lenses; (4) contextualize with competitive dynamics, capital structure, and ESG/governance developments.
Data & sources used
Company disclosures: 2019–2023 financials, 2024 trading/2025 updates; segment mix, margin progression, cash flow bridge. 
Street/industry: Analyst rating changes (e.g., Bank of America upgrade; RBC downgrade) and the ice cream business separation narrative. 
Secondary: Academic finance texts for methodology framing and a Porter’s Five Forces lens. Full references are listed in the PDF.

Methodology (how the valuation was built)
1) Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)
Forecasts FCF from revenues, operating margins, reinvestment (CapEx & working capital), and taxes. 
Base-case WACC: 9% and terminal growth: 3%, with a Gordon Growth terminal value and a sensitivity table varying WACC and g. 
Illustrative result in the report: an enterprise value derived from PV of forecast FCFs + discounted TV; upside range aligns with a per-share value c. £52–£68 depending on assumptions. 

2) Residual Income (RI)
Starts from Net Income, subtracts an equity charge (cost of equity × beginning equity) to compute residual income, then discounts at the cost of equity. 
Adds the PV of forecast RI to current book value; includes a terminal residual income component. 

3) Market Multiples
Cross-checks valuation using P/E, EV/EBITDA, and P/S, applying sector-typical multiples to Unilever’s earnings, EBITDA, and sales base; the three-point average provides a comparative anchor to the intrinsic estimates. 

Sanity checks & triangulation
Peer benchmarking (P&G, Nestlé, J&J) on margins, ROA/ROE, EBITDA %, EPS, liquidity, leverage, inventory turnover, and cash conversion cycle to see where Unilever structurally lags/leads. 
Scenario/sensitivity across discount rates and growth to show how upside/downside bands move.

Business & financial highlights you cover
Scale & mix: Global portfolio with c. 190+ countries; 30+ “Power Brands”; focus markets under a Growth Action Plan. 
Top line: 2023 turnover €59.6bn (–0.8% YoY reported) against 7.0% USG (price +6.8%; volume +0.2%); Power Brands up ~5.3% in 2024 updates. 
Profitability: Underlying operating profit ~€9.9bn in 2023; UOP margin ~16.7% (+60 bps); gross margin +200 bps on pricing/mix/cost control. 
Cash flow: FCF rebounded to ~€7.8–7.9bn in 2023; FCF margin ~12.8%; consistent dividends and buybacks. 
Balance sheet: Solid asset base with goodwill/intangibles reflecting brand equity; leverage higher than peers but serviced by robust cash generation.

Competitive dynamics & moat
Moat drivers: Brand equity, scale efficiencies, deep retailer integration, and category leadership (80% of revenue from 1/2 positions). 
Porter’s Five Forces: Low entry threat (scale/brands/regulatory hurdles); strong buyer power (large retailers/price-sensitive consumers); material substitute threat (private label, natural/DIY); intense rivalry (P&G, Nestlé, Colgate). Implications are explicitly tied back to valuation assumptions. 

Segment & margin discussion
Tracks gross/operating/net margin trends (2019–2023) with commentary by segment: Personal Care highest operating margin; Ice Cream lowest. Links to pricing, input inflation, and mix changes.

Peer benchmarking (what you compare and why it matters)
Profitability: Unilever’s net margin (~10.9%) and EBITDA margin trail P&G/Nestlé/J&J, while ROE remains strong (~31%)—a signal that capital structure and asset intensity differ across comps. 
Liquidity: Current ratio ~1.35; quick ratio ~1.05—adequate but behind best-in-class. 
Leverage: Debt-to-equity ~2.3×, above peers; the report explains cash-flow support and the trade-off between tax shield vs. flexibility/risk. 
Efficiency: Inventory turns (~5.9×) and CCC (~48 days) lag peers—an operational upside lever you flag. 
Valuation: EPS lower vs peers and P/E ~19–20× vs higher peer multiples, implying either lower growth/quality—or relative value—depending on the thesis.

Governance, ESG & news flow
Leadership change: CEO transition (Hein Schumacher out; long-time exec/CFO Fernando Fernandez in) and investor activism context; you discuss implications for execution velocity and capital allocation. 
Strategic actions: Ice cream separation to sharpen focus on higher-growth categories. Mixed Street reactions captured (BofA upgrade; later RBC downgrade). 
ESG: Progress on renewable energy, packaging commitments, living wage, DEI; you also note revised targets under new leadership and the debate this triggered.

Valuation summary (what your numbers say)
DCF: Base case with WACC 9% / g 3%; sensitivity presented. Implied per-share fair value ~£52–£68 depending on inputs. 
Residual Income: Positive economic profit after equity charge; terminal RI included. 
Multiples: P/E, EV/EBITDA, P/S cross-checks; triangulation provides a market-anchored range. 
Call: The body of the report moves from an initial “Moderate Buy” framing to a Buy/Strong Buy conclusion with double-digit to ~35% upside versus spot at publication.

Risks you identify (and how you frame them)
Inflation & input volatility → margin squeeze risk despite pricing power. 
Consumer trade-down / private label → volume elasticity risk in core categories. 
FX & macro given global footprint. 
Execution around portfolio reshaping (e.g., ice cream separation) and working-capital efficiency improvements. 

How to reproduce / extend
Use Unilever Balancesheet.xlsx as a starting point for historic BS items and plug into your FCF/RI models. (If you prefer, split the model into Inputs, Operating Model, DCF, RI, Comps tabs.)
Recreate USG → revenue, margin and reinvestment bridges to derive NOPAT and FCF.
Run DCF with WACC 7–11% and g 1–4% to map sensitivity.
Build a simple RI schedule (book value roll-forward + RI + terminal RI).
Pull a peer set (P&G/Nestlé/J&J) for comp-table updates, then refresh the multiples cross-check.
Reconcile to the report’s headline ranges and document assumptions in the README.

What’s distinctive about this project
Combines three valuation lenses with force-of-competition analysis, peer benchmarking, and governance/ESG to provide a decision-grade view rather than a single-method output. 
Connects operational levers (pricing, mix, supply-chain/CCC) directly to valuation outcomes via margin and FCF paths.
