# Unilever-Equity-Research-Report
Welcome to my comprehensive equity research project on Unilever PLC, a global leader in the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector. This project was developed as part of my academic coursework in finance and investment, and it brings together strategic analysis, financial modeling, and valuation techniques to assess the investment potential of Unilever.

About the Project
This research dives deep into Unilever’s business fundamentals, financial health, competitive landscape, and valuation. It covers a 5-year period (2019–2023) and applies real-world tools used by equity analysts and institutional investors.

Through this project, I aimed to answer a core question:

Is Unilever PLC a sound long-term investment based on its current financials, market position, and strategic outlook?

What’s Included
Research Report (PDF): A 100+ page in-depth equity research document covering Unilever’s financial statements, ratios, valuation models, ESG performance, and analyst commentary.

Excel Financial Models: Balance sheet and income statement data, valuation calculations using Discounted Cash Flow (DCF), Residual Income, and Multiples approaches.

Strategic Analysis: Porter’s Five Forces, industry benchmarking, SWOT insights, and a review of management changes and activist investor impact.

Investment Recommendation: Based on the analysis, I issue a "Strong Buy" recommendation with a target price range of £52.00–£68.40, reflecting up to 35% upside from the current market price.

Key Insights
Robust Financials: Unilever has shown consistent revenue growth, resilient margins, and stable cash flow generation despite global economic pressures.

Valuation Approaches:
DCF Analysis estimates intrinsic value based on long-term free cash flow.
Residual Income captures economic profit above cost of capital.
Market Multiples compare Unilever with peers like Procter & Gamble and Nestlé.
ESG & Sustainability: Unilever remains a leader in sustainability and corporate responsibility, though recent delays in some ESG targets reflect ongoing operational challenges.
Peer Benchmarking: While Unilever’s margins trail competitors, its strong brand equity and scale provide a wide economic moat and long-term potential.

Why This Project Matters
This isn’t just a school assignment — it’s a demonstration of applied finance. It reflects my ability to:
Conduct deep research using real company data
Apply valuation frameworks used by analysts
Translate numbers into strategic insights
Critically assess both risks and growth drivers
Whether you're a recruiter, finance enthusiast, or a fellow student — I hope this project gives you a clear view of how I think analytically and execute with depth.
